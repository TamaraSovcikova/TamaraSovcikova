Heyyy, I'm Tamara, an international student from Slovakia. My passion lies in programming and designing apps, and I'm always eager to learn new things to improve my skills. 
Currently, I'm doing my A-levels and working towards my dream job as a software developer. I know there's still a lot to learn, but I'm excited for what the future holds and the opportunities that will come my way.
